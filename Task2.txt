QUESTION 2
    Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, find the sum of all elements 
    which are present in either of the given set.
    Example:
    Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
    Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )
    Use an array as a method.
    Initialize sum = 0. Compare each element of set one with the second set and if element is not present then add that element 
    to sum. Then do the vice versa to add elements from the second set.

ANSWER

STEP 1: Create an array of integer arr1, arr2 and an integer variable sum
STEP 2: Initialize the variable sum to zero to keep track of the sum value
STEP 3: Input values for arr1 and arr2
STEP 4: Iterate through arr1 to compare arr1 to arr2
STEP 5: At every iteration of the loop:
      i. We check for number at index position i of arr1 (arr1[i]) that is not found at any index position of arr2
      When the condition listed above is met then we update the value of the sum variable to arr1[i]
      ii. We update the value of the sum in the next iteration by adding it with previous arr1[i] values

STEP 6: Repeat step 4 to 5 to compare arr2 to arr1
STEP 7: Exit the loop
STEP 8: Print out the value for sum variable outside both loops.
